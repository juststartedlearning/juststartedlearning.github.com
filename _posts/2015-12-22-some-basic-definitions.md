  Today, I learned a bunch of variable definitions that are used quite a bit
  when defining the kind of problem we're trying to solve with Machine Learning.

Here's what I learned today:

- The goal of supervised Machine Learning is to try to make **good guesses**, given the output of many previous guesses.
- How to translate problems from words to mathematics.

### Goal of supervised Machine Learning

Apparently, the entire purpose of supervised Machine Learning is to try and predict an output given (one or more) inputs.

### Some definitions
In the examples I followed, Andrew took the case of housing prices. His imaginary friend, James, wanted to sell his house and came to Andrew asking for advice. What he then did was look at a bunch of different factors (e.g size of the house) and the impact this had on the price of the house.

There's a couple of important defintions to note here:

1. The price of the house (what we're trying to estimate) is called the **output**, referred to by the symbol $$y$$
2. The
